 * T here is a generic type.  It can stand in for any kind of object.
 * Here, our objective is to have an object that can store any object in its 'data' field, and then retrieve it.
 * This doesn't seem useful yet, but in a Collection such as ArrayList, you could have a generic
 * array that can store and retrieve many items of any type. This feature is needed for collections, web server
 * technologies, and advanced database interactivity (ORMs).
 * *
 * For this problem, let's say we just need an Object that is able to manage a single Object of any type - T data.
 * For now, we just need to save and retrieve data.
 *
 * @param <T> a placeholder for any type of object.
