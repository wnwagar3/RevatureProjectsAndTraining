/**
 * In this JPA Repository interface, we will be exploring JPA's ability to infer queries from method names. We'll
 * refer to these as query methods. While JPA does allow the developer to include their own database queries, many
 * operations are simple enough that they can be adequately described using a specific method name.
 *
 * Spring can perform different forms of filtering or aggregation based off of the fields provided in your entity.
 * The book class has the following fields provided:
 *     private long id;
 *     private long isbn;
 *     private String title;
 *     private String author;
 *     private boolean available;
 *     private int pages;
 *     private Timestamp dateAdded;
 *     private Timestamp lastDateWithdrawn;
 *
 *     The test cases for this lab will attempt to identify the query methods you've written and run them.
